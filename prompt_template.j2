You are an expert on macOS applications. I will provide you with a list of macOS apps and their available metadata. For each app, please provide a clear, concise one-sentence description that explains what the app does.

Write simple, direct descriptions that focus on the core functionality. Avoid marketing language, superlatives, and phrases like 'perfect for', 'ideal for', 'designed for', 'suitable for', 'catering to', etc.

Examples of good descriptions:
- 'Downloads videos, playlists, channels, and subtitles from YouTube and other platforms.'
- 'Professional digital audio workstation for music production and live performance.'
- 'Blocks ads and trackers across web browsers.'

Examples of bad descriptions:
- 'A user-friendly application perfect for content creators who want to save online content for offline viewing.'
- 'An innovative app designed for users seeking a distraction-free experience.'

Format your response as a JSON object where each key is the app name and each value is the description.

Here are the apps to describe:

{% for app in apps %}
App Name: {{ app.name }}
{% if app.description %}App Description: {{ app.description }}
{% endif %}{% if app.version %}Version: {{ app.version }}
{% endif %}{% if app.bundle_identifier %}Bundle ID: {{ app.bundle_identifier }}
{% endif %}Path: {{ app.path }}

{% endfor %}
Please provide your descriptions in JSON format.
